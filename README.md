# Awesome Holochain

A curated list of awesome holochain resources, tools, community hApps and examples.

This is an ongoing effort to make visible important resources in the Holochain ecosystem.

If you want to add some resource, we welcome Pull Requests!

## Tools and libraries

> Keep in mind that these libraries and mixins are a work in progress: they may vary in their published status.

* [Anchors mixin](https://github.com/holochain/holochain_anchors): easily create anchors for multiple types of entries.
* [Roles mixin](https://github.com/eyss/holochain_roles): adds global role management, but needs the [progenitor pattern](https://forum.holochain.org/t/progenitor/1063) to be used in the DNA.
* [File storage](https://github.com/eyss/holochain_file_storage): general file storage zome with a frontend library to plug and play (very slow for now).
* [Generic tags](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/generic-tags): generic and dynamic tags for any entry in the DHT.
* [Social triangulation](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/social-triangulation): membrane zome to only allow friends of friends in the DHT.
* [Mutual credit](https://github.com/holochain-open-dev/mutual-credit): general purpose mutual-credit implementation with node-to-node messaging.
